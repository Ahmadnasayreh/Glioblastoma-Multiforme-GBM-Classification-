Utilized machine learning techniques to classify Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.
Implemented and evaluated six machine learning algorithms: KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost, with data preprocessing, SMOTE for balancing, and feature selection.
Achieved highest accuracy of 99% using Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models, demonstrating their effectiveness with precision, recall, and F1-score all at 0.99.
